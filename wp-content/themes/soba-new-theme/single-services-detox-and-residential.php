                <h2>SOBA Personal Assessment</h2>
                <p><strong>Anyone who suffers from addiction to alcohol or drugs has a unique set of circumstances. In
                        other words, we have found time and time again that, “one size doesn’t fit all.”</strong></p>
                <p class="gap">Each person has family relationships, livelihoods, upbringings, socio-economic
                    backgrounds, and experiences that are unique in nature. More importantly, our entire treatment team
                    knows from years of research that the physical ailments may also contribute to addiction and/or
                    alcoholism. As a result, a detailed assessment is performed for the development of an individualized
                    treatment plan by the treatment team. During the assessment process, a biopsycho social profile is
                    created and a primary therapist is assigned for the entire length of the clients stay with us.</p>

                <h2>Our Professional & Safe Detox</h2>
                <p><strong>Some individuals may not believe they need medical supervision during the detoxification
                        period, it is vital to undergo supervised detox to ensure the client’s safety.</strong> If
                    you’re trying to get clean and change your lifestyle, the scariest part is often the detox. Perhaps
                    you’ve tried detoxing before, only to find that the withdrawal symptoms and cravings were too much
                    to deal with.</p>
                <p class="gap"><strong>That’s where SOBA Recovery Center can help.</strong> We’re a luxury detox, and
                    our goal is to keep you as pain-free and comfortable as possible while you detox. Detox is a crucial
                    procedure that aims to expel the chemicals from the individuals system. Some signs of withdrawal may
                    include changes in vital signs which can be indicative of a life-threatening condition and as a
                    result detox should never be attempted unsupervised. Depending on the type of substance the client
                    has been abusing, detox can take anywhere from 7 days to 20 days.</p>
                <p class="gap">Our unique detox system is monitored by some of the best clinicians in Southern
                    California, and utilizes cutting edge techniques to make the process as safe and comfortable as
                    possible.</p>
